## Requirements

- Have assets subdirectory populated with assets.
- Don't have any droplets, droplet images, or volumes named assetsbuild.

## Initialize packer

This is probably only needed once?

    packer init deploy/deploy_template.pkr.hcl

Validate requirements and configuration locally

    ansible-playbook -i deploy/hosts deploy/requirements_conf_prod_playbook.yml
    packer validate -var-file=conf/variables.pkr.hcl deploy/deploy_template.pkr.hcl

## Build volume

    packer build -var-file=conf/variables.pkr.hcl deploy/deploy_template.pkr.hcl

## Create snapshot of volume and clean up

- In digitalocean console, create snapshot of assetsbuild volume with default name.
- In digitalocean console, destroy assetsbuild volume.
- In digitalocean console, destroy all assetsbuild volume snapshots but most recent.
- In digitalocean console, destroy assetsbuild droplet snapshot.

## Notes

community.digitalocean.digital_ocean_snapshot is the ansible collection to snapshot volume

volume snapshot downgrade:
- check out appropriate release to match asteriskserver
- create volume snapshot

asteriskserver stage deploy:
- create, provision, etc droplet
- list assetsbuild volume snapshots, find most recent
- create, mount assets volume from assetsbuild snapshot

asterisksever stage promote:
- decommission, delete etc futel-prod-back droplet
- destroy assets volume mounted to futel-prod-back
- delete all assetsbuild volume snapshots but most recent

asteriskserver prod downgrade:
- make snapshot of current futel-prod droplet
- delete futel-prod droplet
- create droplet from futel-prod-back
- XXX create, mount volume of appropriate revision
