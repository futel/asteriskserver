## Deploy an asterisk server to Digital Ocean

## Require or install requirements

ansible-playbook -i deploy/hosts requirements_conf_prod_playbook.yml
ansible-playbook -K -i deploy/hosts requirements_packages_generic_playbook.yml

## Test

cd src/var/lib/asterisk/agi-bin
python3 -m unittest discover test

## Deploy stage asteriskbox to digital ocean manually

create or check out release branch

create droplet and subdomain:

  ansible-playbook -i deploy/hosts deploy_digitalocean_playbook.yml --vault-password-file=conf/vault_pass_digitalocean.txt

note IP address printed
note stage conf version printed
wait for DNS to propagate with "nslookup futel-stage.phu73l.net"

deploy stage:

  ansible-playbook -i deploy/hosts update_assets_playbook.yml    
  ansible-playbook -i deploy/hosts baseinstall_playbook.yml --vault-password-file=conf/vault_pass_prod.txt --extra-vars conf_version=<stage conf version>
  ansible-playbook -i deploy/hosts update_asterisk_playbook.yml --vault-password-file=conf/vault_pass_generic.txt
  ansible-playbook -i deploy/hosts update_asterisk_sip_playbook.yml --vault-password-file=conf/vault_pass_prod.txt --extra-vars conf_version=<stage conf version>  
  ansible-playbook -i deploy/hosts secure_playbook.yml
  ansible-playbook -i deploy/hosts sync_playbook.yml
If sync_playbook failed, preserve any recordings downloaded to tmp/stage/recordings
  ansible-playbook -i deploy/hosts post_sync_playbook.yml

if testplan has changed since last release branch, update google sheet testplan,
keeping dates of nonupdated completed tests
test stage against google sheet testplan

## promote stage to prod

  ansible-playbook -i deploy/hosts hostname_playbook.yml
rename futel-prod.phu73l.net droplet to futel-prod-back
rename futel-stage.phu73l.net droplet to futel-prod.phu73l.net
  ansible-playbook -i deploy/hosts sync_playbook.yml
If sync_playbook failed, preserve any recordings downloaded to tmp/stage/recordings
  ansible-playbook -i deploy/hosts post_sync_playbook.yml
remove A record for futel-stage.phu73l.net (in own DO domain interface)
change A record for futel-prod.phu73l.net to point to new futel-prod.phu73l.net
point all callcentric DID forwarding rules to extensions corresponding to new conf_version on futel-prod.phu73l.net
  futel-r2d2 user to foo|bar
point all voip.ms DID forwarding rules to subaccounts corresponding to new conf_version on futel-prod.phu73l.net
  185060_prod-foo|bar subaccount
wait for DNS to propagate with "nslookup futel-prod.phu73l.net"
make a snapshot of futel-prod-back

ansible-playbook -i deploy/hosts post_promote_playbook.yml --vault-password-file=conf/vault_pass_digitalocean.txt

remove snapshots of futel-prod-back except for most recent

test that prod outgoing calls work
test that prod incoming call to incoming line works
test that prod incoming calls to extensions work or get channel unavailable
test that prod incoming calls to extensions work (may take time)

## update iptables

This is done after a new vpnbox is deployed.

  ansible-playbook -i deploy/hosts secure_playbook_prod.yml
