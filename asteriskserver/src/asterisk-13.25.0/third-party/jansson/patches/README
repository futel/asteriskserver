Patches should be added here once merged to the upstream jansson project at
https://github.com/akheron/jansson/.  Patch filenames should be generated by
running 'git format-patch ${JANSSON_VERSION}' from the jansson repository, then
copying the required patches to this folder.

Any changes to configure.ac or Makefile.am must be stripped from the upstream
patches.  The upstream project does not commit `autoreconf -i` output files
and we must ensure bundled jansson does not require autoconf or automake.
Changes to test files can also be stripped as the bundled builds do not run
jansson tests.
