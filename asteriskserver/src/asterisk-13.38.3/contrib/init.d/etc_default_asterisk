# Startup configuration for the Asterisk daemon

# Uncomment the following and set them to the user/groups that you
# want to run Asterisk as. NOTE: this requires substantial work to
# be sure that Asterisk's environment has permission to write the
# files required  for  its  operation, including logs, its comm
# socket, the asterisk database, etc.
#AST_USER="asterisk"
#AST_GROUP="asterisk"

# If you DON'T want Asterisk to start up with terminal colors, comment
# this out.
COLOR=yes

# If you want Asterisk to run with a non-default configuration file,
# uncomment the following option, and set the value appropriately.
#ALTCONF=/etc/asterisk/asterisk.conf

# In the case of a crash, Asterisk may create a core file.  Uncomment
# if you want this behavior.
#COREDUMP=yes

# Asterisk may establish a maximum load average for the system.  This
# may be useful to prevent a flood of calls from taking down the system.
#MAXLOAD=4

# Or, if you'd prefer, you can limit the maximum number of calls.
#MAXCALLS=1000

# Default console verbosity.  This may be raised or lowered on the console.
# Note this is analogous to the -v command line switch, which by default
# will cause Asterisk to start in console mode and run in the foreground,
# unless the always fork (-F) option is also provided.
#VERBOSITY=3

# Enable internal timing if the DAHDI timer is available.  The default
# behaviour is that outbound packets are phase locked to inbound packets.
# Enabling this option causes them to be locked to the internal DAHDI
# timer instead.
#INTERNALTIMING=yes

# Start all recordings into a temporary directory, before moving them to
# their final location.
#TEMPRECORDINGLOCATION=yes
