Subject: res_srtp

SRTP replay protection has been added to res_srtp and
a new configuration option "srtpreplayprotection" has
been added to the rtp.conf config file.  For security
reasons, the default setting is "yes".  Buggy clients
may not handle this correctly which could result in
no, or one way, audio and Asterisk error messages like
"replay check failed".
