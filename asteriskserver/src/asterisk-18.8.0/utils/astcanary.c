/*!\brief
 * At one time, canaries were carried along with coal miners down
 * into a mine.  Their purpose was to alert the miners when they
 * had drilled into a pocket of methane gas or another noxious
 * substance.  The canary, being the most sensitive animal, would
 * immediately fall over.  Seeing this, the miners could take
 * action to escape the mine, seeing an imminent danger.
 *
 * This process serves a similar purpose, though with the realtime
 * priority being the reason.  When a thread starts running away
 * with the processor, it is typically difficult to tell what
 * thread caused the problem, as the machine acts as if it is
 * locked up (in fact, what has happened is that Asterisk runs at
 * a higher priority than even the login shell, so the runaway
 * thread hogs all available CPU time.
 *
 * If that happens, this canary process will cease to get any
 * process time, which we can monitor with a realtime thread in
 * Asterisk.  Should that happen, that monitoring thread may take
 * immediate action to slow down Asterisk to regular priority,
 * thus allowing an administrator to login to the system and
 * restart Asterisk or perhaps take another course of action
 * (such as retrieving a backtrace to let the developers know
 * what precisely went wrong).
 *
 * Note that according to POSIX.1, all threads inside a single
 * process must share the same priority, so when the monitoring
 * thread deprioritizes itself, it deprioritizes all threads at
 * the same time.  This is also why this canary must exist as a
 * completely separate process and not simply as a thread within
 * Asterisk itself.
 *
 * Quote:
 * "The nice value set with setpriority() shall be applied to the
 * process. If the process is multi-threaded, the nice value shall
 * affect all system scope threads in the process."
 *
 * Source:
 * http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/000095399/functions/setpriority.html
 *
 * In answer to the question, what aren't system scope threads, the
 * answer is, in Asterisk, nothing.  Process scope threads are the
 * alternative, but they aren't supported in Linux.
